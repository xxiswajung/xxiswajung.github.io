We present VELCRO, a visual-based programming tool that enables intuitive construction, modification, analysis, and generation of deep learning models for both expert and non-expert developers. VELCRO allows users to understand and modify complex architectures of deep learning models using architecture abstraction, and verify architectures through automated architecture validation. Finally, users can convert the user-configured architecture into deep learning code and deploy it in target environments.
