I'm Hwajung Yoo and a master student of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. Currently, Iâ€™m actively looking for full-time SWE or SDE position starting from June 2025 and please look through my [CV](files/HwajungYoo_CV.pdf). 

My research interests are Computer Vision and LLMs. Particularlly, I focus on Image Restoration and AI agents. I am doing research on AI agents for HealthCare to predict the potential disease.

I have previously worked on full-stack projects with Ruby on Rails, React and Django involving AWS services. I am experienced in Python and C as well, and I hope to improve my skills in full-stack development through software development or engineering opportunities.
